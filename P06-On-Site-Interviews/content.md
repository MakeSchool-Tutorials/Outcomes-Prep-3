The final round interviews at companies are often "On Site Interviews." These are at the company's office and often involve a combination of technical and behavioral interviews.

Here's a checklist of things to do before and after the interview

## Before the Interview:-
* Research what is typically asked in this company’s interviews, practice those questions. This information can sometimes be found on Google, Glassdoor, Google, Reddit and Quora. Practice answering these questions.
* List the questions you have about the company
* Prepare to arrive 20-15 minutes early
* Pack your bag before you go to sleep:
  * clothes you will wear - these should match the company's culture and maybe be a bit more formal
  * notepad
  * pen
  * print outs of your resume
  * computer bag  
  * water bottle

Research company news and recruiters:
- (5 min) Look up interviewers on LinkedIn (if you know who will be interviewing you): do we know someone in common - you can mention your similarities in the interview. It opens the door to the conversation, know the seniority of people you are interviewing with.
- (3 min) Stock prices and recent funding … this gives you a sense of how valuable this company is in the marketplace and how valuable their stock options will be for you. This can help you gauge the $ value of the opportunity you are going in at - we’ll cover more of this in the final stages of the interview process.

## After Interview
* Send hand written Thank You notes to every single person you met on an interviews
* Linkedin connect to every single person you came in contact with from the company.
* Send a follow up email thanking them for the opportunity to interview and asking what the next steps are and when you will hear back.
