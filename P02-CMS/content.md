Bill Clinton won the US presidency primarily because he was a phenominal networker.

He didn't just meet people. He took meticulous notes and tracked his interactions.

Read this article for a bit of inspiration: [Bill Clinton was a Ridiculously Good Networker at Age 22](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-clinton-networking-2011-5).

He won the presidency because he built his base of followers and remembered who they were and what was important to them.

Similarly, by keeping track of our applications – where we apply, when, dates to follow up, etc – we can navigate our search with great ease.

Let's level up our contact management skills.

##Contact Management System (CMS)

A contact mangement system (CMS) is a database to keep track of all important information about a contact. People and companies set up CMS's to:

1. stay organized: list all information you need per job search contact (date met, email, phone, next action, waiting on - etc)
1. ensure they don't miss deadlines
1. coordinate which tasks should take priority

To make things easy, we've made a template CMS for you to build on...
