## Apply to 10 companies on your list

Which applications are best to prioritize?

It's hard to say.

But here are some things to consider...

- Apply to match and fallbacks first. This way, you'll get experience interviewing with companies who are not your top pick. By applying to and interviewing at these companies first, you'll have even more practice for when you apply to your top picks.
- Apply to meet application deadlines, if they are listed.

You may also want to reach out to employees at your top choices companies *before* you apply. This way, you can learn more about their company culture and mention your conversation in your cover letter. LinkedIn is a great tool to connect with company employees both before and after you apply.

Apply away!

## After applying
- If it is a partner company, tell Susan to message their hiring team to raise your visibility. Here is a [template message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FD52I6tKofC1zpZyLWmX1BCQw5WDPkmzimvDSK_E_nM/edit#heading=h.7noej9mqhlr6) you can send to Susan.
- If you don't hear back from a recruiter or company in a week or two, send a message to them ever week or so until you get a response. This will show that you are persistent and really want the role!
- Note your next steps with this application in your CMS. Also note when you want to follow up if you don't hear back from them.
- Message anyone who helped you apply or friends you have at the company. Thank them!
